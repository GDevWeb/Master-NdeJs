### Section 2: JavaScript - A Quick Refresher

#### **14. `let` & `const`**

---

#### **What are `let` and `const`?**

Introduced in ES6, `let` and `const` are modern ways to declare variables in JavaScript. They provide better control over variable scope and reduce potential errors compared to the older `var` keyword.

---

#### **Key Differences Between `let`, `const`, and `var`**

| Feature               | `let`                       | `const`                     | `var`                                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Reassignment**      | Allowed                     | Not allowed                 | Allowed                                |
| **Scope**             | Block-scoped                | Block-scoped                | Function-scoped                        |
| **Hoisting Behavior** | Hoisted but not initialized | Hoisted but not initialized | Hoisted and initialized as `undefined` |
| **Usage**             | Mutable variables           | Immutable variables         | Legacy code (not recommended)          |

---

#### **Using `let`**

1. **Reassignable Variables:**  
   Use `let` when the value of the variable needs to change later.

   ```javascript
   let count = 1;
   count += 1;
   console.log(count); // Output: 2
   ```

2. **Block Scope:**  
   Variables declared with `let` are only accessible within the block (`{}`) they are defined in.

   ```javascript
   let x = 10;

   if (true) {
     let x = 20; // This x is scoped to this block
     console.log(x); // Output: 20
   }

   console.log(x); // Output: 10
   ```

---

#### **Using `const`**

1. **Immutable Variables:**  
   Use `const` when the variable’s value should remain constant. It cannot be reassigned after its declaration.

   ```javascript
   const name = "Alice";
   // name = "Bob"; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
   console.log(name); // Output: Alice
   ```

2. **Block Scope:**  
   Like `let`, `const` is also block-scoped.

   ```javascript
   const age = 30;

   if (true) {
     const age = 25; // This age is scoped to this block
     console.log(age); // Output: 25
   }

   console.log(age); // Output: 30
   ```

3. **Objects and Arrays with `const`:**  
   While you can’t reassign a `const` variable, you _can_ modify its contents if it’s an object or array.

   ```javascript
   const person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
   person.age = 31; // This is allowed
   console.log(person); // Output: { name: "Alice", age: 31 }
   ```

   ```javascript
   const colors = ["red", "green"];
   colors.push("blue"); // This is allowed
   console.log(colors); // Output: ["red", "green", "blue"]
   ```

---

#### **Why Use `let` and `const` Instead of `var`?**

1. **Avoid Scope Issues with `var`:**

   - `var` is function-scoped, which can lead to unexpected behaviors.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     if (true) {
       var x = 10;
     }
     console.log(x); // Output: 10 (accessible outside the block)
     ```

     Compare with `let`:

     ```javascript
     if (true) {
       let y = 20;
     }
     // console.log(y); // Error: y is not defined
     ```

2. **Reduce Bugs:**
   - With `let` and `const`, variables are not initialized until their declaration, reducing the chances of referencing undefined variables.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     // console.log(a); // Error: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
     let a = 10;
     ```

---

#### **Best Practices**

1. Use `const` by default.

   - This makes your code more predictable and avoids accidental reassignment.

2. Use `let` only when you know the value will change.

   - Example: Loop counters or variables that get updated in your code.

3. Avoid `var` unless maintaining legacy code.
   - Modern JavaScript codebases rarely use `var`.

---

#### **Practical Example:**

1. Declare a `const` for a person object and modify one of its properties:

   ```javascript
   const person = { name: "John", age: 25 };
   person.age = 26; // Allowed
   console.log(person); // Output: { name: "John", age: 26 }
   ```

2. Use `let` in a loop:
   ```javascript
   for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
     console.log(i);
   }
   // console.log(i); // Error: i is not defined
   ```

---

#### **Mini-Exercise:**

1. Create a variable using `let` and reassign its value twice.
2. Declare an array using `const`, then add new elements to the array.
3. Try modifying a `const` variable and observe the error.

---

#### **Vocabulary for Technical English**

- **Scope:** Defines where a variable can be accessed in the code.
- **Block-Scoped:** Variables accessible only within the block (`{}`) where they are declared.
- **Reassignable:** A variable that can have its value changed after declaration.
