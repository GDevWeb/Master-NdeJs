### **Additional Tips for Learning**

1. **Experiment with Core Modules:**

   - Practice creating small projects using `fs`, `http`, `events`, and `path` to solidify your understanding.

2. **Dive into Asynchronous Programming:**

   - Use `setTimeout`, Promises, and `async/await` in practical applications to understand how the event loop works.

3. **Build Mini Projects:**

   - Create an HTTP server, implement routing, and add basic logging or error handling.

4. **Keep the Docs Handy:**
   - Refer to the official Node.js documentation regularly when experimenting or debugging.
