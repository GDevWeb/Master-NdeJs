### **Topics Covered**

1. **Code Formatting and Linting:**

   - Tools to enforce consistent code style and catch errors early (e.g., **Prettier**, **ESLint**).

2. **Version Control:**

   - Best practices for managing code changes with **Git**.

3. **Nodemon:**

   - Automatically restart your Node.js server during development.

4. **Debugging Tools:**

   - How to debug Node.js applications using built-in tools and external debuggers.

5. **Environment Variables and Configuration:**

   - Managing sensitive data and app configuration using tools like **dotenv**.

6. **Logging:**

   - Implementing effective logging with libraries like **Winston** or **Morgan**.

7. **Package Management with npm:**

   - Optimizing dependency management and using scripts effectively.

8. **Error Handling and Debugging Best Practices:**
   - Techniques to catch and manage errors gracefully.
