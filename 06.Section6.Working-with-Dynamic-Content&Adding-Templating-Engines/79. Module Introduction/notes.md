In this section, we will explore how to create **dynamic content** in Express.js applications using **templating engines**. Templating engines make it easier to generate HTML dynamically, allowing you to:

1. **Inject Data** into HTML templates.
2. **Reuse Components** across different pages.
3. **Simplify Code** and improve maintainability.
