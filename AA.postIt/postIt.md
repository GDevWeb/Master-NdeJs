### **30. Understanding Requests**

- [notes](../03.Section3.Understanding-The-basics/30.Understanding-Requests/notes.md)

- **Request:** A message sent by the client to the server asking for a resource or service.
- **Headers:** Metadata sent with a request or response.
- **Body:** Data sent with the request, often in JSON or form-data format.
- **Query Parameters:** Key-value pairs appended to a URL for additional context.

## **31. Sending Responses**

- [notes](../03.Section3.Understanding-The-basics/31.Sending-Responses/notes.md)

- **Response:** The server's reply to a client's request.
- **Status Code:** A number indicating the result of the request.
